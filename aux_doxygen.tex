** \file cm_libdebug.h
**
** \abstract
**
** This file contains  API for libdebug library. It  should be used by
** whatever   software  using   this  lib.    This library  implements
** different capacities of debugging, warning, erroring and offers the
** possibility to send output trace/debug message on different devices
** such syslog, file, socket ...
**
** The purpose of the API is to  offer a simple interface for printing
** and debugging   informations in  user  applications  with  only one
** macro:  CM_DBG_TRACE.  This macro  is a  frontend of 'fprintf' with
** following improvements and features :
**
**    - 1 - Output format : The ouput format is variadic type, so that
**    all printf format specification is  supported .  Furthermore, in
**    order  to support also   debugging,  the macro  incorporate  the
**    standard C99 __LINE__, __FILE__ and  __func__ macro , so that it
**    is  possible to improve  debugging  and trace  in  a application
**    without  modifying the code.  All  this  aspects are embedded in
**    the CM_DBG_TRACE macro.
**
**    -  2 - Output  device : in order to  send output trace and debug
**    informations, the   device on which  all traffic  is sent can be
**    choosed   by  user    at startup   time  during   initialisation
**    phase. Different kind of device are allowed, such :
**
**         - standard file
**         - standard BSD syslog API
**         - UDP IPV4 unicast socket
**         - TCP IPV4 unicast socket
**         - device STDOUT
**         - device STDERR
**
**    - 3 - Dynamic management: the output format can be change at run
**    time without  changing or recompiling application.  For exemple,
**    at startup time,  the default value  can be only to edit message
**    on syslog, and later, a API is available to change the format by
**    adding __FILE__ and/or other characteristics. This management is
**    implemented with state machine so that there are no interruption
**    in debug data flow.
**
**    - 4  -  Real time aspect: All   ressources reservation  are done
**    during   initialisation phase, so   no   memory nor  thread  are
**    allocated during normal life of API.
**
**    - 5 - End to end  communication: When sending debug and/or trace
**    on a system, it is some time critical  to be sure that integrity
**    of the  session is correct  bettween message n  and message n+1.
**    In  order to do  that, a  prefix counter (  like other  __LINE__
**    prefix  ) is available  and  can be  used / unused  dynamically.
**    This counter is 32 bit wide and is / is not in all messages.  It
**    is user responsabilitie to verify coherence bettween message (n)
**    and message (n+1).  This behavior can  help when sending message
**    on UDP protocol for exemple for detection on broken message when
**    a message is  dropped by  the  network (for integrity point   of
**    view).  It implement a 'session' counter mechanism with a simple
**    algorythm:  (counter   ++),  so that   end  point  communication
**    application can verify correct transmission.
**
**    -  6 - Date  prefix: On complex network system,  it is some time
**    mandatory to have  date  information on event message   from the
**    origin    daemon  with   high    occuracy.   Of   course  Syslog
**    implementation  (sylogd/syslog_ng)  install  local date  on each
**    event/message, and, with this feature, it  is possible to manage
**    complex  network if syslogd daemon is  present.  But at the same
**    time,   syslog is used  with a  resolution about  second, and in
**    order to  have  a datation with  more  occuracy , it  is not the
**    solution. Furthermore, the datation is done from syslogd daemon,
**    not from initial daemon logger  end point.This API incorporate a
**    similar  mechanism in order to   install a date  pattern on each
**    line event message.  In order to  minimize real time impact when
**    getting date on local system, no  Posix time API is used because
**    overhead can  not be supported  on embbeded system, and also due
**    to the fact that there are cases on which rescheduling can occur
**    when getting date.  The proposal implementation is to use a very
**    light 'date' API based on new hardware feature available on most
**    todays platform.   This feature is know  as 'rdtsc' on X86/IA32,
**    but exist  also on ARM, PPC  and other MIPS architecture.  It is
**    often a hardware counter running at CPU  clock or near.  The bad
**    news is that this feature is not  normalize and as a consequence
**    hardware dependant.   Furthermore, it  depends of the  CPU clock
**    (please  care   must  be  taken   on   laptop  system).  Another
**    disavantage of this   mechanism  is that  getting date  is   not
**    synchronize   with any  other  system  such as   NTP,   and as a
**    consequence, the validity of  time is only local,  but it is the
**    MAJOR  requirement.  The good  news is as this implementation is
**    very light,  it is  possible to  have  extreme occuracy on event
**    datation message.  Please look  at libcommn 'cycle' component in
**    order to have more informations.  On  modern system, the 'rdtsc'
**    counter is  very often a 64 bits  counter, so the format used in
**    this feature  is  simpler 64  bits  long  (\%lld) ,  it is  user
**    responsabilitie to   manage  this  information and  make   other
**    correlation  or  treatment    on  the  data    flow produced  by
**    CM_DBG_TRACE.   As a conclusion,  this feature  is one option as
**    the others format  options  and must  be used  in case  of  high
**    occuracy.
**
**    - 7 - Thread safe. No thread  are used in this  API, and also no
**    lock, mutex or other synchronisation mechanisms are used.
**
**    - 8 -  Non blocking mode: some  time, when using monoprocess  or
**    monothread applications, it is mandatory to never block in order
**    to be  sure to  manage correctly input  traffic  on 'select' (or
**    equivalent) synchronisation   point.  In order  to  be compliant
**    with  this requirement, the  API  offer a double  mechanism when
**    using  output traffic  on  TCP  socket.  First  is the  standard
**    native Posix blocking mode in which all call to CM_DBG_TRACE are
**    synchronous, and of course, some time, this call block depending
**    of TCP windows and  length of SO_SNDBUF   buffer socket in  your
**    application.  Second is  the possibility to used CM_DBG_TRACE in
**    a non blocking mode on TCP protocol.   Of course, in order to do
**    that, a    local  buffer  must be    preallocated  (only  during
**    initialisation  phase)   and output  traffic  is  write  to this
**    buffer.  In  this case, it   is user  responsabilitie to  manage
**    later  this  traffic buffer   with a   Posix 'select'  or  other
**    equivalent mechanism.  Furthermore, is is also possible for user
**    to choose SO_SNDBUF Posix option  parameter.  To end about  this
**    feature, the last (but not least) is  the ability to support non
**    blocking mode when creating output traffic  with SYN TCP packet.
**    In  this case,  a timeout  can be  choosen  in order  to overlap
**    standard  Operating System parameter.    Please note  this  last
**    feature never use /proc or  /sys OS parameter,  it is only based
**    on  standard Posix non  blocking  socket API.  Please  note that
**    'non blocking mode' is under development.
**
** Before  calling any of libdebug services,  it is  mandatory to call
** only once cm_debug_init,  otherwise all services respond with error
** code ( conform to REQ_SOFT_ARCH_0060 )
**
** \dependencies
**
** The  'debug'    LIBCOMMON module use    module  'cycles' and module
** 'socket'.  This 2 modules   are used until  cm_libdebug_release  ()
** service is called. Furthermore, during initialisation phase, module
** 'version' is initialised and released  for cm_debug_init() and also
** for cm_debug_release() service.
